I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) advised by Prof. [Faramarz Fekri](https://fekri.ece.gatech.edu/).
My research primarily focuses on Machine Learning, Probabilistic graphical models and Causal Discovery. In particular, I'm interested in
understanding the feasibility of recovering cyclic causal graph structure from observational and interventional data. Previously,
I got my Masters from Georgia Tech and I did my undergraduate studies at National Institute of Technology, Trichy ([NITT](https://www.gatech.edu/)).

In my free time I like to do a bit of cooking and running around the streets of Atlanta. I'm currently training for the Publix Half Marathon in Atlanta next year.
